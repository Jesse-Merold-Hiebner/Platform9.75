Cinema Booking Ticket Management system.

Domain problem: Entertainment: 

Example: www.amctheatres.com

A movie theatre company has approached our business to create a new Cinema Ticket Booking system with stability and futureproofing in mind as the legacy system is outdated and not capable of implementing new features or technologies.

Some key features the client has requested:

Various membership levels
The ability to add consumables to your booking.
The ability to check available time slots without the need to phone in first.
